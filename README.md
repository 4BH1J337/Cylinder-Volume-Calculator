# SolidCal

 This calculator is to easily calculate the volume of geometric solids including a **Cylinder, Cone, Cuboid,** and **Sphere**.
 The input values can be given in multiple metric/units:  mm, cm, in, and the volume of every shape is calculated.</br>
User can select the desired shape from the Shape drop-down list and the entry fields will automatically configure as per input requirements for each mentioned shape.</br>
Application is built using Python programing language (3.10) and Tkinter framework for Graphical User Interface (GUI).
