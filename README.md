# Volume Calculator
#
### This calculator is to easily calculate the volume of geometric solids including a cylinder, cone, cuboid, sphere. The input values can be given multiple metric/unit:  mm, cm, in. The volume of every shape is calculated differently using different formulas.
### User can select the desired shape from the Shape drop-down list and the entry fields it automatically configures as per input requirements for each mentioned shape.
