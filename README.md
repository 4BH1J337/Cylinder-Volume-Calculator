# Volume Calculator

 This calculator is to easily calculate the volume of geometric solids including a **Cylinder, Cone, Cuboid,** and **Sphere**.
 The input values can be given in multiple metric/units:  mm, cm, in, and the volume of every shape is calculated differently using different formulas.</br>
User can select the desired shape from the Shape drop-down list and the entry fields will automatically configure as per input requirements for each mentioned shape.
# Features
* Standard Calculator functionality offers basic operations and evaluates commands immediately as they are entered.
* Multiple shapes and Metric/Unit operations.
* Auto Liters conversion as per selected unit
