# Volume Calculator

 This calculator is to easily calculate the volume of geometric solids including a **Cylinder, Cone, Cuboid, Sphere**. The input values can be given multiple metric/unit:  mm, cm, in. The volume of every shape is calculated differently using different formulas.</br>
User can select the desired shape from the Shape drop-down list and the entry fields are automatically configures as per input requirements for each mentioned shape.
# Features
* Standard Calculator functionality which offers basic operations and evaluates commands immediately as they are entered.
* Multiple shapes and Metric/Unit operations.
* Auto Liters conversion as per selected unit
